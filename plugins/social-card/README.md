# gatsby-plugin-social-card

Creates social-cards (read by Twitter, Facebook, Slack for previews) for your posts.

This plugin is inspired by [gatsby-remark-social-cards](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-social-cards/?=card) and [Kent's site](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com). I wanted something in between the two styles, but automatically generated.

## Features

### Custom backgrounds

### Uses cover images when available

### Different overlay-styles (soon)

## Using

### Requirements

- gatsby-source-filesystem
- gatsby-plugin-sharp

## Pitfalls

### Fonts

We use sharp to convert our SVG images to JPG. The means that the fonts available to you are limited to those of the build-machine.

I wanted something a bit more flashy, yet autogenerated with post-title on it.
