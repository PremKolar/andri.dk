      <p>
        <br />
        My job at <b> Lufthansa Technik </b>ended on September 20th 2020. <br />
        <br />
        <img src={niko} alt="<niko.jpg>" width="250"  ALIGN="left" HSPACE="20" VSPACE="0" />
        An initially planned subsequent permanent contract with Lufthansa's
        <b> Industry Solutions </b>
        never materialized after a company-wide hiring freeze was put into place
        in response to the covid-19 economic shock on aviation industries.
        <br />
        <br />
        Equipped with a great employment-reference-letter (TODO link) and 2.5
        years of full-time programming experience, I was extremely confident
        that I would find the next coding job in no time. Having sent out quite
        a number of applications by now, I have come to realise that companies
        are not exactly looking for niche-science-majors (oceanography) who know
        how to code in Matlab.
        <br />
        <br />
        Instead a typical job posting reads like:
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>
          ...<b>Required tech-stack</b>: JavaEE, Spring, Hibernate, JS,
          Vue/React/Angular, CSS, Html, Jenkins, Gatsby, yaml, git, Python,
          Django, MongoDB, Docker/Kubernetes plus ideally experience in AI and
          big data...
        </i>
        etc...
        <br />
        <br />
        The truth of the matter is that especially all the web-related
        technologies and all the frameworks are completely new territory for me.
        <br />
        <br />
        What I can do:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol style={{ listStyleType: "square" }}>
          <li>
            I have sound experience in Object-Oriented-Programming, but I
            acquired such primarily in Matlab and basic Java without the use of
            any extra framework.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have done quite a bit of parallel programming in a scientific
            context.
          </li>
          <li>I have lots of experience in visualizing data.</li>
          <li>I have sound experience in git and Kanban.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      Thus, I decided, I would study these new technologies until I reach a
      sufficient level in enough of them, so that my CV would finally catch the
      eyes of recruiters. Because all I need is someone giving me a chance to
      prove my self on the job, as I know that I would learn whatever is
      required of me swiftly and on the fly. <br />
      <br />
      To keep my CV up-to-date, I had the idea to migrate it from Latex directly
      to the web.
      <br />
      This approach has several benefits:
      <br />
      <br />
      <ol style={{ listStyleType: "decimal" }}>
        <li>I learn web technologies.</li>
        <li>I can directly update my CV about these new achievements.</li>
        <li>
          Using continuous deployment, the recruiters always have the latest
          version of my CV.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <br />
      So, if you read this, you are likely a potential employer or recruiter. If
      you think you might have a job for me, contact me at

          Currently churning through The Dresden Files series (book 8 atm). I
          love these books. They mix together fantasy, old school investigative
          stories and a the Bruce Willis of wizards. Always in the wrong place
          at the wrong time.

          I have a few pet-projects that I'm working on. Mostly for learning

          I'm reading and experimenting with event-sourcing, cqrs and
          domain-driven-design on the backend and on the frontend I'm playing
          with Tailwind CSS.

        <p>
          Our little half-Icelandic, half-Dane, all Viking son keeps us
          entertained and challanged at home. He's soon to be 5 years old and
          his little head is filled with questions that I hope Wikipedia can
          help answer.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          He's already very interested in computers of all sizes, but I dare not
          push it on him. He'll get there if and when he wants to.

          Me and my girlfriend got engaged last October. I proposed during a
          hide-and-seek game with our son. I was going for: "rememberable, but
          silly". I think I nailed it. No date set yet.

          I was forced to quit a job that I loved last April. The could smell
          the burnout coming and had to bail out.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          I took a job in May at an Aarhus based company (1 hour drive).
          Fortunately, they were kind enough to allow me to work from here 4
          days a week. It's still quite new, so we'll see how it works out.
