I am done with the second iteration of a Java-project I've been working on.

At my customer's request, I won't go into details as to what the tool is about. 
Let me just say that I had lots of fun writing it! I have to say I really like Java... Or more precise, I really like coding in Java, using a smart IDE! All the built-in code-completion, refactoring capabilities, pre-compilation bug-hints etc. really bring me joy! Especially with a language like Java, that needs relatively many keywords and lines of code. I would not want to work in Java with say Emacs though! That would be tedious. 

Speaking of Emacs! Fun fact I learnt in a podcast today: The inventor of Java is also the inventor of Emacs! :)
