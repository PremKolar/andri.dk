My initial idea was to manually containerize this site and then host it at eg. Google Cloud.
I had already watched the Frontend Masters course [Complete Intro to Containers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-intro-containers/) and was eager to apply my new skills.

Then I found out about [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and couldn't resist... They make the whole process just too easy! 

All I had to do was: 
*   log in with my github account.
*   select the branch i wanted to deploy.

###
After that, any commit I push to github triggers a fresh deploy.

I had no idea how easy this would be :)
