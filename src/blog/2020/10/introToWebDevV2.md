I raced through the FrontendMasters course [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/) in 2 days to clear up some fundamental questions about the **JS/Html/CSS** paradigm.

Most of it was a bit slow, as the course is geared towards people, who have never written a line of code. I thus skipped through the programming fundamentals and played the rest at 2x playback speed.

A very good course and Brian Holt is an awesome teacher!
