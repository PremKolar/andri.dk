Tomorrow I am going kite surfing! The conditions will almost certainly be perfect. Why am I so sure? Because I looked at the forecast model with the best resolution in time and space: [AROME](https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article120&lang=en).

Often times I hear people complain about their _phone_ predicting different weather than some other phone or that Google said you wouldn't need an umbrella, but Siri promised it will rain.

Phones or weather apps or Siri don't make weather forecasts. National institutes run models that produce the forecasts and weather apps etc use those models' outputs.

From my experience, for Northern Germany, the best models are in decreasing order:
1. AROME
2. ICON
3. ECMWF
4. GFS
5. METEOBLUE

###
The finer a model is gridded in space and time, the better its output, but also the costlier its calculation. Therefor the finer-resolved models are shorter range than the coarser ones. AROME delivers a 36-hours short-range forecast that is extremely reliable from my experience.

A good site to compare all models is [windy.com](https://windy.com)!
