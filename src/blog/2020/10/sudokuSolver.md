I wanted to get some JS/React/Html/CSS practice and thus decided to implement a [Sudoku Solver](https://nikoop.de/sudokusolver).

I've been wanting to try this for a long time but never had the time. Now, that I'm _on the dole_, the time had come! The algorithm I chose is loosely based on the faint memories of a youtube video I saw many moons ago, where a funny-looking CS professor presented a very elegant recursive approach in Python. And it works :)! 

Having written a couple more lines of **JS** code now, I am still not sure whether I like it. The language and its semantics seem quite loose/_laisser-faire_/unsafe. I'm not a fan of ambiguities in the code, but I can see how it would help streamline quick developments... I feel like Js is even more extreme than Python in that regard.

Concerning **React**, I'm still put off by the mixing of languages (**JSX**), but then again I don't have the experience of constantly having to manage three different languages separately...
