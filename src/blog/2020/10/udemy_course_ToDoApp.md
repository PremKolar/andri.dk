I've just finished the course [To-Do App & Clean Architecture -Android Development - Kotlin](https://www.udemy.com/course/to-do-app-clean-architecture-android-development-kotlin/). 

[Here]("https://www.nikoop.de/static/2e7cbc6f93033386e66b6369f6262cfd/udemyCertificate_ToDoAppKotlin.pdf")'s my certificate :).

I've also used the course to code my own version of the app alongside the lectures. The result is a _ToKite_-App. This will be very handy for me when I go kiting, because you have to think of at least 20 things you must not forget when you go kiting! 
It is really just a simple ToDo-App but it has the feature to _uncheck_ all checked items with one button. In the app that I had used previously for this purpose (Google Tasks), I had to manually uncheck each item from the archive before every session.
Another neat feature is that each (k)item has a property _season_ which is either summer/winter or allYear. This way you can filter your list according to the time of the year (You don't need sun-screen in December, and no neoprene-hood in August).

Here's the [repo](https://github.com/PremKolar/Kitems).
