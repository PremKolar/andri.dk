Some time ago I decided that I would no longer buy any Sony products. It's not because anyone told me to or because it was "hip" to boycott them. Lately, I have seen Sony releasing some compelling commercial products and it is hard to tell your friends why they shouldn't buy Sony products without sounding like some sort of zealot. I like lists, so I am making a list of Sony's evil doings with sources so people can form opinions of their own. Please excuse the dramatic title, but actions do speak louder than words and I do believe Sony's actions reflect that it is a self-serving, evil corporation that will stop at nothing, to get it's way.

*   2000 - [Rootkit Incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal): _Sony autoloated rootkit software from audio CDs inserted into computers of their customers._
*   2010 - [OtherOS removal from the Playstation 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS) _Researches and others were using Linux (and other operating systems) for research, computing clusters and more all the sudden were unable to do so after updating the firmware on their machines. There was a class-action suit, but it was dismissed in 2011._
*   2011 - [Suing "hackers" for tinkering with their own hardware](http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/12/sony-follows-up-officially-sues-geohot-and-fail0verflow-over-ps/)
*   2011 - [Supporting SOPA](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/115005-EA-Sony-and-Nintendo-Withdraw-SOPA-Support-UPDATED)
*   2011 - [Supporting ACTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement)
*   2011 - [Leaking user data of 77 million PSN users](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/27/playstation-users-identity-theft-data-leak)

If I have forgotten anything, just leave a comment. I have no doubt, that Sony will give me reason to update this post.
