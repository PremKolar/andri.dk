I've got a new job! :)

Building **this** webpage and watching many webdev tutorials on [frontendmasters.com](frontendmasters.com) really paid out! 

I am very much looking forward to apply my high standards of clean code and software craftsmanship to this Vue/Typescript project!

I also realized that Vue is so much more fun than React... :)
