**As a part of my site restoration, this page was salvaged and may not be up to date** ![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/25593/cv-andri-thumbnail.jpg) Once in a while, I have to dust off my CV (resume, Curriculum Vitae) and update it a bit. Originally I looked at the various TeX packages for CV making but I didn't really like any of them. So, I decided to create my own template using TikZ for graphics. You can see a screenshot of my CV on the right of the page or just [download the PDF file](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/25593/cv-andri-en.pdf) for a closer look.  If you're interested in using my template or changing it, you are free to do so. A link to the site is appreciated but not required.
