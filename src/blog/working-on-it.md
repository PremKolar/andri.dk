I'm sorry for the downtime. We had a disk failure and the backup isn't quite what it was supposed to be. I decided to install Drupal 7 (old site was Drupal 6) and repopulate the site manually. Haven't found a good way to migrate the old data. If you know of a good way, feel free to [contact me](/contact).
