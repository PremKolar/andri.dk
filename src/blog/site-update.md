It has been months since I've written anything here, so here is what has happened:

*   I went to Iceland as an intern for 4 months at [Sprettur](http://www.sprettur.is) where I learned a whole bunch of stuff. I also got to attend a Test-Driven-Development and Agile Design courses with [J.B. Rainsberger](http://jbrains.ca) as a part of my job there.
*   I am finishing my studies here, so hopefully I will be looking for a job in February 2011.
*   I also vacationed in Iceland for 20 days with my girlfriend - it was very nice, I have pictures!
*   I went through the old articles from andrioid.net and andri.dk and posted the good ones here.
*   I have an iPad now, courtesy of my friends at Sprettur so I will probably dial down on my Apple bashing for a month or two...
